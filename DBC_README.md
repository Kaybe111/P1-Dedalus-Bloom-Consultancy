# Dedalus & Bloom Consulting

Dedalus & Bloom Consulting is a fictional business consultancy group created for the purpose of the Portfolio1 project which operates in Europe and offers corporations and SMEs a range of services to optimize processes, manage projects and develop strategy in the areas of supply chain, customer services and fintech/instech solutions. The business model is therefore a traditional consultancy setup.

The team of consultants can be contracted on project basis or can be held on retainer to offer a client business the opportunity to work flexibly based on their own demands and plans. The website presents the consultancy and should be attractive to hold the attention of potential B2B clients, offering them tasters and insights of their expertise by detailing some past projects on high level.
